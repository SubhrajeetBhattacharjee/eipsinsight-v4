EIPsInsight Branding Alignment
EIPsInsight is not “just EIPs” — it is:
Observability + Context + Coordination for Ethereum standards
Branding principles reflected in the sitemap:
Insight before implementation (Analytics + Insights are first-class)


Multiple entry points (Explore vs Search)


Protocol-first but human-readable


Upgrade-centric storytelling (dedicated Network Upgrades section)


Role-aware navigation (Editors, Reviewers, Enterprises)


Naming consistency
“Network Upgrades” instead of “N/w Upgrades”


“Standards” instead of “Standards (by repo)”


“Insights” clearly separated from “Analytics”
